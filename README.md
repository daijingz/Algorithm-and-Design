# Algorithm and Design
Jingze Dai's Project, includes lots of algorithm implementations (basic and advanced development) and funny works.

# Documentation

* To see any works about **funs** please see **Interesting Started Ideas** folder. (https://github.com/daijingz/Algorithm-and-Design/tree/main/Interesting%20Started%20Ideas)
* To see various kinds of testing works please see **Testing** folder. (https://github.com/daijingz/Algorithm-and-Design/tree/main/Testing)
* To see **regular files** please see current repository. (https://github.com/daijingz/Algorithm-and-Design)

This project includes algorithm designs with Python, C++, Java and other programming languages (MATLAB, C)' Implementations.

**Reminder**
* This project includes some past works from taken courses, self-working, and funs
* Because of time limits, not all parts are complete. Future contents are coming soon.
* This project have error handling designs on a lot of algorithms.
* If you find any mistakes please give feedback to David directly (**Through emails**)
