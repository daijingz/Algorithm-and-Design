This project includes algorithm designs with Python, C++, Java and other programming languages (MATLAB, C)' Implementations.

**Reminder**
* This project includes some past works from taken courses, self-working, and funs
* Because of time limits, not all parts are complete. Future contents are coming soon.
* Including error handling designs on a lot of algorithms. When you have some problems unsolvable, please look at it first.
* If you find any mistakes please give feedback to David directly (**Through emails**)
